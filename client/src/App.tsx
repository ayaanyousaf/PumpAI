            PumpAI is an AI-powered fitness tracker designed for weightlifters and fitness enthusiasts. 
            Users can log workouts, track sets, reps, and personal records, and monitor habits like sleep 
            and water intake. Unlike standard trackers, PumpAI analyzes training data to surface actionable 
            insights â€” from PR detection and adherence streaks to correlations between lifestyle habits and 
            gym performance. An integrated machine learning module predicts workout consistency and recommends 
            adjustments, helping athletes train smarter, not just harder.
